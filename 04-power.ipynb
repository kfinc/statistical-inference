    "John Ioannides (2005) writes about how most published research findings are false. At\n",
    "the same time, we have learned that if you set your alpha at 5%, the Type 1 error rate (or\n",
    "the probability of a false positive given that the null hypothesis is true) will not be higher\n",
    "than 5% (in the long run). How are these two statements related? Why aren’t 95% of\n",
    "published research findings true?\n",

    "The trick to understanding the discrepancy between the possibility that more than 50%\n",
    "of published findings are false (positives) and the 5% Type 1 error rate is that **two different\n",
    "probabilities are calculated**. \n",
    "- The **Type 1 error** rate is the probability of saying there is an effect, when there is no effect. \n",
    "- Ioannides calculates the **positive predictive value (PPV)**, which is the **conditional probability** that if a study turns out to show a statistically significant result, there is actually a true effect\n",
    "\n",

    "It helps to clearly define the different probabilities that can be calculated when talking\n",
    "about the probability that a published result is a true positive of a false positive.\n",

    "The probability of observing a true positive when there is a true effect is, in the long run, equal to the statistical power of your study. The probability of observing a false positive when the null hypothesis is true is, in the long run, equal to the alpha level you have set, or the Type 1 error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also be interested in knowing what the probability is that if you have observed a significant result in an experiment, the result is actually a true positive. In other words, in the long run, how many true positives can we expect, among all true positives and false positives. This is known as the Positive **Predictive Value (PPV)**. We can also calculate how\n",
    "many false positives we can expect, among all true positives and false positives. This is known as the **False Positive Report Probability** (Wacholder, Chanock, Garcia-Closas, El ghormli, & Rothman, 2004, sometimes also referred to as the **False Discovery Rate**, Colquhoun, 2017).\n",

    "After all, you can only observe a false positive if the null hypothesis is true, and you can only observe a true\n",
    "positive if the alternative hypothesis is true. Whenever you perform a study, you are either operating in a reality where there is a true effect, or you are operating in a reality where there is no effect – but you don’t know in which reality you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform studies, you will be aware of all outcomes of your studies (both the\n",
    "significant and the non-significant findings). When you read the literature, there is\n",
    "**publication bias**, and you often only have access to significant results. This is when\n",
    "thinking about the PPV (and the FPRP) becomes important. If we set the alpha level to 5%,\n",
    "in the long run 5% of studies where H0 is true (FP + TN) will be significant. But in a\n",
    "literature with only significant results, we do not have access to all true negatives, **and it\n",
    "is possible that the proportion of false positives in the literature is much larger than 5%.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume you perform 200 experiments in your lifetime. Let’s also assume that you\n",
    "plan, and miraculously achieve, exactly 80% power in all studies where there is a true\n",
    "effect to be found. Furthermore, you consistently use an alpha level of 5%, and therefore,\n",
    "when there is no true effect to be found, you will observe a false positive 5% of the time.\n",
    "Finally, let’s assume that in 50% of the experiments (i.e., 100 out of 200 experiments) the null hypothesis is true, and in the remaining 50% of the experiments H1 is true. What, on\n",
    "average, can you expect to happen in these 200 studies?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, 2.5% of all studies will be a false positive (a 5% Type 1 error rate, multiplied by a 50% probability that H0 is true). 40% of all studies will be a true positive (80% power\n",
    "multiplied by a 50% probability that H1 is true).\n",
    "For the 85 positive results (80 + 5), the false positive report probability is 5/85 = 0.0588.\n",
    "At the same time, the alpha of 5% guarantees that (in the long run) 5% of the 100 studies\n",
    "where the null hypothesis is true are Type 1 errors: 5% x 100 = 0.05. This is also true. When\n",
    "we do 200 studies, at most 0.05 x 200 = 10 could possibly be false positives (if H0 was true\n",
    "in all experiments). In the 200 studies we performed (and where H0 was true in only 50%\n",
    "of the studies), **the proportion of false positive**s for all experiments is only 2.5%. Thus,\n",
    "for all experiments you do, the proportion of false positives will, in the long run, never be\n",
    "higher than the Type I error rate set by the researcher (e.g., 5% when H0 is true in all\n",
    "experiments), but it can be lower (when H0 is true in less than 100% of the experiments).\n",
    "You can redo these calculations by hand (try them for a scenario where the null\n",
    "hypothesis is true in 40% of the studies, and the alternative hypothesis is true in 60% of\n",
    "the studies).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "What will make the biggest difference in improving the probability that you will find a true positive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the power requires bigger sample sizes, or studying larger effects. Increasing the % of a-priori true hypotheses can be done by making better predictions – for example building on reliable findings, and relying on strong theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "People often say something like: “Well, we all know 1 in 20 results in the published\n",
    "literature are Type 1 errors”. After this assignment, you should be able to understand this\n",
    "is not true in practice. Even when we use a 5% alpha level, it is quite reasonable to assume\n",
    "much more than 5% of significant findings in the published literature are false positives.\n",
    "When in 100% of the studies you perform, the null hypothesis is true, and all studies are\n",
    "published, only then 1 in 20 studies, in the long run, are false positives (and the rest\n",
    "correctly reveal no statistically significant difference). **In the scientific literature, the\n",
    "positive predictive value (the probability that given that a statistically significant result is\n",
    "observed, the effect is true) can be quite high, and under specific circumstances, it might\n",
    "even be so high that most published research findings are false.** This will happen when\n",
    "researchers examine mostly studies where the null-hypothesis is true, with low power, or\n",
    "when the Type 1 error rate is inflated due to p-hacking or other types of bias. Publication\n",
    "bias, power, and Type 1 error rates together determine the probability that significant\n",
    "results in the literature reflect true effects."
